An iOS-like progressive blur implementation for Flutter.

## Usage

See the example folder for a complete example.

> [!CAUTION]
> The CanvasKit web performance seems to be terrible. I'm not exactly sure why at the moment. However, `skwasm` performs much better.

```dart
import 'package:progressive_blur/progressive_blur.dart';

// Simple gradient blur
ProgressiveBlurWidget(
  sigma: 24.0,
  linearGradientBlur: const LinearGradientBlur(
    values: [0, 1], // 0 - no blur, 1 - full blur
    stops: [0.5, 0.8],
    start: Alignment.topCenter,
    end: Alignment.bottomCenter,
  ),
  child: ...
);

// Advanced: custom blur texture
//
// You can create a custom blur texture using the Flutter's Canvas API. Note that the red channel controls the blur strength (0 - no blur, 255 - full blur).
ProgressiveBlurWidget.custom(
  sigma: 24.0,
  blurTexture: [instance of ui.Image],
  child: ...,
)
```
